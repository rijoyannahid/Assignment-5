document.getElementById("id") : It can tSelects a single element with the given id,returns the element object or null if not found,IDs must be unique in the page.

document.getElementsByClassName("className"): Selects all elements with the given class,returns a live HTMLCollection (updates if DOM changes),it needs to loop through it to access multiple elements.

document.querySelector("selector"): It Selects the first element that matches the CSS selector Example: document.querySelector(".myClass"), document.querySelector("#myId").

document.querySelectorAll("selector"): It Selects all elements that match the CSS selector,returns a static NodeList (does not auto-update) and supports modern CSS selectors.

Q-4: What is Event Delegation in JavaScript? Why is it useful?

Event Delegation means attaching one event listener to a parent element to handle events for its child elements, instead of attaching listeners to each child separately, uses event bubbling to detect which child triggered the event

It is useful because,
Improves performance (fewer listeners),Works for dynamically added elements (no need to re-attach).Cleaner, easier to code.
